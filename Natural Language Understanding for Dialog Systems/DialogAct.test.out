Predicted:social Actual:pull-select
Student:  I really liked 370 actually, so I'm thinking something lower level would be more my speed. 
Predicted:social Actual:push-general-info
Student:  Oh! That actually sounds like a good idea. When you say difficult, are you talking in terms of workload? I want to still take some humanites next semester as well. 
Predicted:social Actual:push-conditional
Student:  That sounds like a plan then! I think that's most of what I was worried about. Thanks for your help!

Student:  I am thinking of taking EECS 203, MATH 216, and Physics 140  Maybe a psych class but I'm not sure yet  I want to get a dope internship and I feel like all those classes are important 
Predicted:social Actual:pull-bool
Student:  I am thinking of double majoring psych and cs 
Predicted:social Actual:pull-other
Student:  I want to take 16 credits 
Predicted:push-general-info Actual:pull-bool

Predicted:social Actual:social-open-close
Student:  Hi!

Predicted:social Actual:push-tailored-info
Student:  How heavy is the workload for these two classes?

Predicted:push-tailored-info Actual:social-open-close

Predicted:social Actual:push-tailored-info
Student:  That's a good idea actually, the foundations must be really easy! 
Predicted:social Actual:pull-select
Student:  I'd say AI or maybe Game Development. Could I design AI's in games as a compromise? 
Predicted:social Actual:push-general-info
Student:  Well since that foundations class won't be so hard then I think I could handle it. Unless the scale is out of 2...

Predicted:social Actual:push-general-info
Student:  Are there any prerequisites to it besides EECS 281 and EECS 370? 
Predicted:social Actual:push-general-info

Student:  Im fine, what classes should I take next semester? 
Predicted:push-tailored-info Actual:pull-bool
Student:  I am interested in artificial intelligence 
Predicted:push-tailored-info Actual:push-conditional
Student:  Ok, can you tell me how hard that class is? 
Predicted:push-general-info Actual:push-tailored-info
Student:  I like medium-sized courses, which class would you recommend, Software Engineering or Web Databases? 
Predicted:social Actual:push-conditional
Student:  Ok, thank you for your advice. 
Predicted:social-open-close Actual:social-open-close
Student:  I was wondering if EECS 381 would be a good course to take along with EECS 482?  I have heard that is doable 
Predicted:social Actual:push-general-info
Student:  Would that delay my graduation?  I would like to graduate in 3 years  Should I instead drop my EE major?  I can just major in CS instead of double majoring 
Predicted:social Actual:pull-select
Student:  So instead of EECS 482 is there a class I can take? 
Predicted:push-general-info Actual:push-general-info
Student:  Thanks! 
Predicted:social-open-close Actual:push-general-info
Student:  Oh I was not aware of that!  Thank you for your time

Student:  Hey, I wanted to ask some questions about my class schedule for the next semester. 
Predicted:social Actual:pull-other
Student:  What can you suggest me after taking EECS270 or EECS370? My preferences are a small class size and group project. 
Predicted:social Actual:pull-bool
Student:  No. 
Predicted:social-open-close Actual:push-tailored-info
Student:  Okay, awesome. I heard from my friends that the workload for this class is really heavy. What do you think? 
Predicted:social Actual:push-tailored-info
Student:  Alright, I need to think about this a little bit more. If I have any other questions, I'll stop by again. Thank you very much!

Predicted:social Actual:pull-fill
Student:  So far, 281 has been my favorite!  along with EECS376 
Predicted:social Actual:push-tailored-info
Student:  What is the workload like for EECS445? 
Predicted:push-general-info Actual:push-tailored-info
Student:  I have never done web development but I am eager to learn 
Predicted:social Actual:pull-fill
Student:  I haven't really been very interested in hardware  Since that is a requirement maybe I will take EECS370 with either EECS445 or EECS485 
Predicted:social Actual:push-general-info
Student:  Will definitely be taking EECS370 next semester  thanks for your help

Student:  I prefer CS 
Predicted:push-tailored-info Actual:pull-bool
Student:  Yes, I'm interested in database. How's the workload for EECS 484? Since I will need more time to find a job, I might not choose taking multiple courses with heavy workloads 
Predicted:social Actual:push-tailored-info
Student:  That sounds great. What's the class time? 
Predicted:push-general-info Actual:push-general-info
Student:  I can work with that. Thank you professor!

Predicted:social Actual:push-general-info
Student:  Okay that sounds perfect! Uhm I am the most interested in software. Are there any other courses you could suggest? 
Predicted:social Actual:push-conditional
Student:  Oh wow that sounds very interesting! Do you think taking EECS 481 and EECS 484 together would be manageable? 
Predicted:social Actual:push-general-info
Student:  Oh okay yeah I would want to take another class, are there any other EECS courses that have a lighter load? 
Predicted:social Actual:push-tailored-info
Student:  Okay artificial intelligence sounds very interesting, I will consider taking it.  Is EECS 492 a project based course?
